third project for social computing, premise was to find whether or not there was a significant difference in "opinion strength" between male and female users,
"opinion strength" meaning more positive (like good vs fantastic, fantastic would have a higher opinion strength) or more negative. It finds subjects and then finds 
the adjectives and modifiers related to the subject to quantify this.
